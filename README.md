# Web application using Hibernate/Spring/SpringMVC (with UI)
The project is implemented using the following technologies: Maven, Spring, JPA(Hibernate), Bootstrap(CSS)/ jQuery. Data storage is implemented using MS SQL Server.

# Short description
This project is a simplified version of a real web application which is a tool for statistics analysis. In real live there is another application that is used for collecting and handling data from oracle database. May be some day I'll add this application to git too. By the way, it is c# windows service.
